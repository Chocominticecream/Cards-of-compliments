Felt that I could have done more art instead of coding, I mostly coded for a lot of the game and forgot to produce enough art to make it look appealing so it looked a little bland. I also added lot of unnecessary things like a level system and ending screen, when I should have just done one level so that I have more time to do art. I tend to enjoy coding a little more than creating art so it is why it unfortunately turned this way. I just have to learn from my mistakes and do better going forward in my next game jam.

Overall though, its a good experience I suppose and it did prepare me better to do projects in crunch time.

This game will also not be updated anymore unless I feel like it.
